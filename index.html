            <h1>A Little About Me...</h1>
            <p>My name is Diana, I was born and raised in San Antonio, TX.  I love the Spurs, hiking, trips to the beach and hanging with my 2 cats, my dog and family!
            </p>

            <p>   I have a diverse background that includes a 13 year career working in the food & beverage/hospitality industry, over 5 of those years as a sales representative for the largest wine & spirits distributor in the US, where I became a level 1 Sommelier. 
            </p>
                
            <p>   I chose to enter into the UX/UI Design world because I enjoy the creativity it allows me, as well as continuing my passion for working with clients and helping people, and also bridging gaps to help stakeholders and consumers alike in the ever evolving digital world. 
            </p>    
            <p>Cheers!</p>
